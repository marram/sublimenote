Markdown Notes for Evernote in Sublimetext
===================================

Allows you to create and edit Evernote notes in Markdown.

How it works
------------

1. You create a new note: menu -> new note (or assign keybord shortcut).
2. Whenever you save, it writes the note back to Evernote but in HTML formatk. ie: converted Markdown. But it also attaches the original Markdown file to the note. It also tags the note with a `markdown` tag, so that you can re-open it in Sublimetext.

Limitations
-----------

This will support text notes only for now.
